**How to Deploy Locally**
1. Create a new repository using the template.
2. Clone the repository and open it locally.
3. Open the Terminal and navigate to the `frontend` directory.
4. Run the following:
   ```
   npm i
   npm run dev
   ```

Just a simple template for designing websites, so that I can spend more time on what's important rather than the bare bones.
